# QA Automation Journey

This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming a
**QA Automation Engineer / SDET**, focusing on real-world automation
skills rather than only course-based learning.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals, scalable automation logic,
and an engineering mindset aligned with **remote and relocation-ready roles**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop solid QA & automation fundamentals
- Learn Selenium WebDriver with Java effectively
- Build maintainable and scalable test structures
- Practice testing scenarios close to real production systems
- Prepare for technical interviews (QA / SDET roles)

---

## 🧭 Learning Approach

This repository follows a **learning-in-public** approach.

Each study day includes:
- Topics learned
- Hands-on practice
- Key technical takeaways
- Notes for improvement and next steps

This is not just note-taking — it reflects applied learning.
