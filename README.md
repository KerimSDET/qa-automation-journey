# QA Automation Journey

This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming a
**QA Automation Engineer / SDET**, focusing on real-world automation
skills rather than only course-based learning.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals, scalable automation logic,
and an engineering mindset aligned with **remote and relocation-ready roles**.
